# PROS Documentation


This repository hosts the documentation for [PROS for V5 and Cortex](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros). These docs are hosted
at https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/.

## How are these docs built?

The PROS docs are built with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). The
theming is a modified version of the [Read The Docs theme](http://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
which can be found at [this fork](https://github.com/purduesigbots/sphinx_rtd_theme).

A few Sphinx extensions are used as well:

* [Ablog](http://ablog.readthedocs.io/) - Used to generate the release notes blog posts
* [Sphinx-tabs](https://github.com/djungelorm/sphinx-tabs) - Used for the code tabs found
  in the API docs and tutorials. This is also modified from its original state, and that
  fork can be found at [this fork](https://github.com/purduesigbots/sphinx-tabs).

## Contributing

The requirements to build the docs site (with no modifications to anything but the
source (`.rst`) files) are as follows:

* Python3
* Sphinx (pip package)
* Sphinx-tabs (pip package)
* Ablog (pip package)

To install all of the dependencies for building the PROS Documentation, run

```
# Recommend working in a virtual environment, but the following 2 lines are optional
> python3 -m venv ./docs-venv
> . ./docs-venv/bin/activate

> pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Git Submodules

The `sphinx_rtd_theme` and `sphinx-tabs` folders within the documentation are
[git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). As a result,
you need to initialize these submodules and pull them separately when updating the docs.

```
> git submodule init
> git submodule update --recursive
```

### Building the Docs

Once you have installed the requirements and cloned the submodules, building is
very straightforward. Just run `make` in the root directory.

### Testing the Docs

One viable option for testing the docs is running `make` as specified above and
serving the build directory. However, for testing changes iteratively the process
of saving, building, and reloading the page can be cumbersome. To this end, we
recommend you use the `sphinx-autobuild` package:

```
# install the package (e.g. in the virtual environment)
> pip3 install sphinx-autobuild
# build and serve the v5 site, watching files for changes and hot-reloading
> sphinx-autobuild v5 build
```

A downside of this is that it seems you can only serve one of the three sites
in this repository at once (v5, cortex, home), but most of the time that is
sufficient.

### Modifying the tabs theming

Modification of the tabs theming should be done within the [SIGBots fork of the tabs extension](https://github.com/purduesigbots/sphinx-tabs). Testing modifications to the
theming is often easier done from within the main docs repo; since the theming is just CSS
no compilation is required outside of the typical build process.

### Modifying the general theming

Modifying the Read the Docs theme is a much more difficult process to get set up than the
tabs theming, but is very straightforward after the initial work.

Walk through the following steps to modify the `sphinx_rtd_theme` folder/repo
(Assuming WSL):

```
1. Install virtualenv: sudo pip install virtualenv.
2. Set up a virtual environment with: virtualenv.
3. Install ruby with: sudo apt-get install ruby-full. Just sudo apt-get install ruby won't work.
4. Install SASS: sudo gem install sass
5. Install Node.js: sudo apt-get install nodejs
6. Install npm: sudo apt-get install npm
7. Install Bower and Grunt: sudo npm install -g bower grunt-cli
8. Finalize installation with: sudo npm install
9. Symlink nodejs to node with: sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
10. Reinstall xdg-utils for some unknown reason with: sudo apt-get install --reinstall xdg-utils
11. Symlink xdg-open to the start command (only works with more recent versions of WSL I guess) with: sudo ln -s start xdg-open
12. Install x3m because StackOverflow said to and it worked: sudo apt-get install w3m
13. Configure xdg-settings with: xdg-settings set default-web-browser w3m.desktop
```

From there, you can start a build watch process and server by running `grunt` in
the `sphinx_rtd_theme` folder.

If you want to also build in a different folder (i.e. building in the `sphinx_rtd_theme`
folder of this repo as well as building our fork of the theme), then run
`sudo npm install` in that folder.
