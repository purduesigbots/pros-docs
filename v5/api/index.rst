To aid in transitioning from `PROS 2 <../../cortex/index.html>`_ syntax to PROS 3, a `Legacy API Header <./api-legacy.html>`_
is provided. This header provides PROS 2 functionality in its original syntax.

   ./api-legacy

For additional RTOS-related features, check out the `Extended API <../extended/apix.html>`_. Be warned, these features
are intended for advanced users only and may be very complex to use.
