Async Motion Profile Controller

.. contents:: :local:

okapi::AsyncMotionProfileController
===================================

An ``AsyncController`` which generates and follows 2D motion profiles. Throws a
``std::invalid_argument`` exception if the gear ratio is zero.

This controller is internally backed by `Pathfinder <https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder>`_. There are a few open issues users should be aware about:

- Pathfinder cannot generate negative velocities, so backward movements and very tight turns do not work
    - Moving backwards: `<https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder/issues/39>`_
    - Tight turns: `<https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder/issues/38>`_
- Very long movements (typically movements much longer than a VEX field) can potentially never reach maximum speed
    - `<https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder/issues/43>`_

Methods
-------

generatePath
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generates a path which intersects the given waypoints and saves it internally with a key of pathId.
Call executePath() with the same pathId to run it.

If the waypoints form a path which is impossible to achieve, an instance of ``std::runtime_error``
is thrown (and an error is logged) which describes the waypoints. If there are no waypoints, no
path is generated.

.. tabs ::
   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

        void generatePath(std::initializer_list<Point> iwaypoints, const std::string &ipathId)

============ ===============================================================
 Parameters
============ ===============================================================
 iwaypoints   The waypoints to hit on the path.
 ipathId      A unique identifier to save the path with.
============ ===============================================================

----

controllerSet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writes the value of the controller output. This method might be automatically called in another
thread by the controller. This just calls ``setTarget()``.

.. tabs ::
   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

        void controllerSet(std::string ivalue) override

============ ===============================================================

      ::

        std::string getTarget() override

**Returns:** The last target.

----

waitUntilSettled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Blocks the current task until the controller has settled. This controller is settled when it has
finished following a path. If no path is being followed, it is settled.

   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

        void waitUntilSettled() override

----

moveTo

----

moveTo
~~~~~~

Generates a new path from the position (typically the current position) to the target and blocks
until the controller has settled. Does not save the path which was generated.

.. tabs ::
   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

        void moveTo(
          std::initializer_list<Point> iwaypoints,
          const PathfinderLimits &ilimits,
          bool ibackwards = false, bool imirrored = false
        )

   .. tab :: Example
     .. highlight:: cpp
     ::

       controller.moveTo({
         Point{0_m, 0_m, 0_deg},
         Point{3_ft, 0_m, 45_deg}
       })

============ ===============================================================
 Parameters
============ ===============================================================
 iwaypoints   The waypoints to hit on the path.
 ilimits      The limits for this path only.
 ibackwards   Whether to follow the path backwards.
 imirrored    Whether to follow the profile mirrored.
============ ===============================================================

----

getError
~~~~~~~~

Returns the last error of the controller. Does not update when disabled. This implementation always
returns zero since the robot is assumed to perfectly follow the path. Subclasses can override this
to be more accurate using odometry information.

.. tabs ::
   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

        Point getError() const override

**Returns:** The last error of the controller.

----

isSettled
~~~~~~~~~

Returns whether the controller has settled at the target. Setting is when the error or derivative
of error has been small enough for a long enough period.

If the controller is disabled, this method must return true.

.. tabs ::
   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

        bool isSettled() override

**Returns:** Whether the controller is settled.

----

reset
~~~~~

Resets the controller's internal state so it is similar to when it was first initialized, while
keeping any user-configured information. This implementation also stops movement.

.. tabs ::
   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

        void reset() override

----

flipDisable
~~~~~~~~~~~

Changes whether the controller is off or on. Turning the controller on after it was off will NOT
cause the controller to move to its last set target, unless it was reset in that time.

.. tabs ::
   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

        void flipDisable() override

----

flipDisable
~~~~~~~~~~~

Sets whether the controller is off or on. Turning the controller on after it was off will NOT
cause the controller to move to its last set target, unless it was reset in that time.

.. tabs ::
   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

        void flipDisable(bool iisDisabled) override

============= ===============================================================
 Parameters
============= ===============================================================
 iisDisabled   Whether the controller should be disabled.
============= ===============================================================

----

isDisabled
~~~~~~~~~~

Returns whether the controller is currently disabled.

.. tabs ::
   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

        bool isDisabled() override

**Returns:** Whether the controller is currently disabled.

----

tarePosition
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sets the "absolute" zero position of the controller to its current position.

This implementation does nothing because the API always requires the starting position to be
specified.

.. tabs ::
   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

        void tarePosition() override

----

startThread
~~~~~~~~~~~

Starts the internal thread. This should not be called by normal users. This method is called by the
``AsyncControllerFactory`` when making a new instance of this class.

.. tabs ::
   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

        void startThread()

----

getThread
~~~~~~~~~

Returns the underlying thread handle.

.. tabs ::
   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

          CrossplatformThread *getThread() const

**Returns:** The underlying thread handle.

~~~~

loadPath
~~~~~~~~~

Loads a path from a set of CSV files. The path must exist in the directory as 
<ipathId>.<left/right>.csv

The path can then be run with ``setTarget`` as if it had been just generated.

.. tabs ::
   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

        void loadPath(std::string idirectory, std::string ipathId)

============ ===============================================================
 Parameters
============ ===============================================================
 idirectory   The directory that the paths are stored in
 ipathId      A unique identifier for the path that is both the base filename and the name to be loaded
============ ===============================================================

~~~~

storePath
~~~~~~~~~

Stores a path into a set of CSV files. 
The path must have already been generated and the directory must exist on the SD card.
``idirectory`` can be, but is not required to be, prefixed with /usd/. 

The path is stored as two files, <ipathId>.left.csv and <ipathId>.right.csv.

.. tabs ::
   .. tab :: Prototype
      .. highlight:: cpp
      ::

        void storePath(std::string idirectory, std::string ipathId)

============ ===============================================================
 Parameters
============ ===============================================================
 idirectory   The directory that the paths are to be stored in
 ipathId      A unique identifier for the path that is both the base filename and path identifier
============ ===============================================================
