Motion Profiling is a controls algorithm that defines a movement as a series of
steps. In one dimension, it defines a motor's position, speed, acceleration, etc.
at every timestep during the movement. In two dimensions, it defines your robot's
position, speed, acceleration, etc. and heading at every timestep during the movement.

There is a lot of interesting math that goes into calculating these values, which
you can learn about in examples like these:

OkapiLib, through `Pathfinder <https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder>`_, does
this math for you and ties both the motion profiling and profile following actions
to the same `async controllers <../walkthrough/autonomous-movement-async.html>`_ that
are used for other simpler movements. Because OkapiLib's motion profile generation uses
`Pathfinder <https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder>`_, there are a few open issues you should
know about:

- Pathfinder cannot generate negative velocities, so backward movements and very tight turns do not work
    - Moving backwards: `<https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder/issues/39>`_
    - Tight turns: `<https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder/issues/38>`_
- Very long movements (typically movements much longer than a VEX field) can potentially never reach maximum speed
    - `<https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder/issues/43>`_

First, let's initialize a Chassis Controller to pass into the factory method for the
motion profile Async controller. Following that, you can create a profile Async Controller.

.. note:: The "linear" properties of the chassis given to ``AsyncControllerFactory::motionProfile``
          are for its forward/backwards movements, not the maximum properties for turning or other
          movements.

.. highlight:: cpp
.. code-block:: cpp

   using namespace okapi;

   auto myChassis = ChassisControllerFactory::create(
     {-1, -2}, // Left motors
     {3, 4},   // Right motors
     AbstractMotor::gearset::red, // Torque gearset
     {4_in, 12.5_in} // 4 inch wheels, 12.5 inch wheelbase width
   );

   auto profileController = AsyncControllerFactory::motionProfile(
     1.0,  // Maximum linear velocity of the Chassis in m/s
     2.0,  // Maximum linear acceleration of the Chassis in m/s/s
     10.0, // Maximum linear jerk of the Chassis in m/s/s/s
     myChassis // Chassis Controller
   );

   void opcontrol() {
   }

Next, let's create a motion profile. A profile is created with a list of points and a name.
Each of the points contains the desired (x, y) coordinates and heading. The points given to the
controller form a path from the first given point to the last, with the first point assumed to be
the current position of the robot. The path will be generated
assuming that all of the points are relative to the first, so if you pass in
an x value of ``-1 * 4_ft`` for the first point, then passing an x value of ``0_ft`` for the second
point will result in a forward movement of 4 feet.

.. note:: This function computes the set of steps for the desired profile, which
          may take some time.

.. highlight:: cpp
.. code-block:: cpp

   profileController.generatePath({
     Point{0_ft, 0_ft, 0_deg},  // Profile starting position, this will normally be (0, 0, 0)
     Point{3_ft, 0_ft, 0_deg}}, // The next point in the profile, 3 feet forward
     "A" // Profile name
   );

After the profile is created, it is added to a map of available profiles stored in the controller.
You can then set a target using the name you gave the profile.

.. highlight:: cpp
.. code-block:: cpp

   profileController.setTarget("A");

And then as with any `AsyncController <../../api/control/async/abstract-async-controller.html>`_,
you can call ``waitUntilSettled()``
to block program execution until the movement is finished and the robot reaches the
desired end point.

.. highlight:: cpp
.. code-block:: cpp

   profileController.waitUntilSettled();

Wrap-up
=======

In total, here is how to initialize and use a 2D motion profiling controller:

.. highlight:: cpp
.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   using namespace okapi;

   auto myChassis = ChassisControllerFactory::create(
     {-1, -2}, // Left motors
     {3, 4},   // Right motors
     AbstractMotor::gearset::red, // Torque gearset
     {4_in, 12.5_in} // 4 inch wheels, 12.5 inch wheelbase width
   );

   auto profileController = AsyncControllerFactory::motionProfile(
     1.0,  // Maximum linear velocity of the Chassis in m/s
     2.0,  // Maximum linear acceleration of the Chassis in m/s/s
     10.0, // Maximum linear jerk of the Chassis in m/s/s/s
     myChassis // Chassis Controller
   );

   void opcontrol() {
     profileController.generatePath({Point{0_ft, 0_ft, 0_deg}, Point{3_ft, 0_ft, 0_deg}}, "A");
     profileController.setTarget("A");
     profileController.waitUntilSettled();
   }
