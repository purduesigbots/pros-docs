One of the most important factors in utilizing feedback controllers is establishing proper
exit conditions. If a feedback controller decides that it has reached its target and exits too early,
then the target will never be met. Alternatively, if the controller takes too long to realize that it's
at its goal, the best case scenario is that the movement is just a bit slower, but in the worst case
the movement may never be considered complete, leaving the motors humming indefinitely.

OkapiLib's `SettledUtil <../../api/control/util/settled-util.html>`_ provides three different parameters
for tuning this exit condition: ``atTargetError``, ``atTargetDerivative``, and ``atTargetTime``. We'll
take a further look at tuning these three parameters.

atTargetError
=============

``atTargetError`` is the maximum error value for the controller to consider itself "settled", or
conclusively at its target. This value can also be thought of as the precision for the controller's
movement; if a controller with an ``atTargetError`` value of 10 is moving towards a target of 100,
then the movement could be considered done at any value between 90 and 110.

It would be ideal to be able to set 0 for this value and theoretically ensure that the controller
ends up exactly at its target with every movement, but this is a very good way to end up in the
indefinite motor humming scenario detailed at the top of the tutorial. At the very least this value
needs to be greater than the mechanical slop in the system (the amount that the sensor can move
without encountering resistance from the motors), but typically this value will be closer to the
default of 50.

To disable this check, set the maximum value for a double.

atTargetDerivative
==================

``atTargetDerivative`` is the maximum *change in error* that the controller can be observing and still
consider itself settled. This value helps prevent scenarios where the controller considers itself settled
while quickly passing by the target and oscillating.

To disable this check, set the maximum value for a double.

atTargetTime
============

``atTargetTime`` is the minimum amount of time that the controller must stay in the range of
``Target +- atTargetError`` to be considered settled. This also helps prevent a false settled
scenario when oscillating around the target.

To disable this check, set 0.
