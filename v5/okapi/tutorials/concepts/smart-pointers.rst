.. warning:: This documentation is for OkapiLib version 3.x.x, and might be inaccurate for versions 4.x.x and above. Documentation for the latest version can be found

**Smart Pointers** are a C++ concept that extend the functionality of C pointers.
A knowledge of Smart Pointers is not necessary for simple to intermediate OkapiLib programs,
but extending OkapiLib's functionality (i.e. adding your own control algorithm) will require
that you know how to use smart pointers. Smart Pointers may seem complicated at first, given their
more complex syntax compared to the
simple '*' and '&' operations with traditional pointers, but they make it much safer and easier
to handle memory.

Given that Smart Pointers are a standard C++ feature and not specific to OkapiLib, a plethora
of guides on the subject can be found elsewhere on the Internet. We recommend the following tutorial:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh279674.aspx

The above tutorial will give you the majority of the information you will need to use Smart Pointers.
That said, it is worth noting some conventions with Smart Pointer use in OkapiLib.

There are three types of Smart Pointers: ``unique_ptr``, ``shared_ptr``, and ``weak_ptr``. As of the
time of writing, there are no uses of ``weak_ptr`` in OkapiLib.

``unique_ptr`` is used for parameters to an object that will take exclusive ownership of the object that is
pointed to by the ``unique_ptr``. A good example of this is the ``IterativeController`` parameter
to an ``AsyncWrapper``. The ``AsyncWrapper`` takes control of the ``IterativeController`` and handles
all future movements executed by the controller because you wouldn't want another object trying to interact with
the same ``IterativeController``.

``shared_ptr`` is used for parameters to an object that should be able to be used by more than one other object.
The ``ControllerInput`` and ``ControllerOutput`` parameters to the same ``AsyncWrapper`` class are good examples
of this. While it is typical that your ``AsyncWrapper`` controller will be the only object using the ``ControllerInput``
data and the only object writing to the ``ControllerOutput`` (typically a motor or motor group) object,
it is bad practice to prevent other objects from accessing that data if, for instance, you also wanted a class
to monitor and log the ``ControllerInput`` data. ``shared_ptr`` is a good choice if there is a possibility that
the user will want to use the pointer's object for more applications than the class you're designing.
