Learning a new coding platform is often a rather daunting task. For this
reason we prepared some small tutorials with examples on how to interact
with OkapiLib on your VEX V5 system.

The OkapiLib tutorials are split into two sections:

Walkthrough Tutorials
=====================

If you want to write full sample programs to learn to use OkapiLib through practical
applications, or teach students to use OkapiLib in a classroom environment, the
**Walkthrough Tutorials** are a great resource to go step by step through the
process of writing an OkapiLib program.

Topical Tutorials
=================

If you want more information about using a particular part of the OkapiLib API after
reading through the `API reference <../api/index.html>`_ , the **Topical Tutorials**
offer longer examples and more detail about using the API.
